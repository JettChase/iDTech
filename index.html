<h1>I Dislike James Using HTML</h1>
<p>James, I really dislike the way you use HTML. Your code is always so messy and difficult to read. You never use the correct tags, and your indentation is always off. It's a nightmare trying to work with your code.</p>
<p>I know you think you're a great HTML programmer, but you're not. You're a complete disaster. Please, for the sake of everyone who has to work with your code, learn how to use HTML properly.</p>
